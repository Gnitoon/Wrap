### [App homepage](https://wrap20.web.app)

A simple and collaborative list of things that happened in the year

### why? 

2020 was being tought, sometimes i see people listing things that happened this year, adding the last bad news and thats pretty sad, one more day, one more sh**.

Trying to find a real and complete version was not so easy (ended on a massive scroll of images)

I think on this project more as a rewind not only for bad events, for someone on the future that is searching for this year easily get what need.


## Collaborate
One goal is to have commuity helping make it a good info hub

More details and event example as JSON are availabe in [readme file](https://github.com/Matsukii/wrap20/blob/events/readme.md) on [events](https://github.com/Matsukii/wrap20/tree/events) branch
