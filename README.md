A simple and collaborative list of things that happened in the year

### why? 

2020 was being tought, sometimes i see people listing things that happened this year, adding the last bad news and thats pretty sad, one more day, one more sh**.

Trying to find a real and complete version was not so easy (ended on a massive scroll of images)

I think on this project more as a rewind not only for bad events, for someone on the future that is searching for this year easily get what need.
